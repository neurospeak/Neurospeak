  In our project NEUROSPEAK, our team has designed a website using HTML, Javascript, and CSS to educate parents of kids with Autism and Dyslexia, including 2 quizzes for the parents in order to make an observation on the kind of dyslexia/autism the child may have. It provides resources for the child along with instructions on how to assist their child. We've also created a way for children to interact with the website using puzzles, short quizzes, pronunciation, and a few games for them to play with.`
